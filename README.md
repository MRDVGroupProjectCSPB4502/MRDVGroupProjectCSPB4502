Team Members: Daniel Shackelford, Vidya Giri, Rouzbeh Salehi Pour, Michael Taylor

### Description

Youtube is an American video streaming platform that serves as a key source of news, entertainment, and reference in the digital age: allowing all ranges of global users to broadcast their videos to the world and view videos that are relevant to their interests. Variety magazine states that in order, “to compile its trending-video rankings, YouTube uses a proprietary algorithm that factors in total views, likes, comments and searches.” This project intends to identify what determines the performance of a trending YouTube video through the analysis of string, numeric, and visual data.

### Summary of Questions and Answers

- What features cause an increase in viewership count for a trending video? (number of likes and dislikes, comment count, video title length, video description length, etc)

- What are common visual features in trending video thumbnails? What is the prevalence of faces in the thumbnail images? What clusters of thumbnails exist? 
  - We were able to detect significant visual features in Youtube thumbnails with facial and object detection models and subsequently created 20 defined clusters. From our analysis we have determined that 63.8% of the trending videos in the US contained a detectable face in the thumbnail. 

### Application of this knowledge

Overall this analysis is directly invaluable to two main groups, creators wanting to grow their viewer base, and YouTube’s engineers wishing to increase user engagement. Creators can use this information to understand what factors into video success and what they can do to improve their viewers' engagement in their content. YouTube can use this information not only to better their creators, but can also use it to determine server loads and site use, as well as determine which categories of videos are most important to their user base and which categories possibly need more support from the platform. Looking further out, this data can be used in the design of other social media systems and in analyzing population response to things like news and its effect on society.
